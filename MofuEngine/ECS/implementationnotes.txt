ECS design:

Scene:
EntityManager:


Entities - identifiers, Entity
created in pools, long with all components that will be needed (components can have enity_id in their init data)

Components - data
can be added and removed at runtime

Systems - logic, update function
transform data
can add and remove at runtime
can enable and disable

Cet - (CSet) a set of components
a game object is an archetype

Transform Component - position, rotation, scale
possibly maintain a dirty list as a subrange
but this requires rethinking transform/entity ties
I actually need:
LocalTransform - for the object, would let me resolve transform hierarchies - somehow store parent entity id, probably UINT_MAX for root
WorldTransform - for rendering


Scripting:
systems iterate over Cets
